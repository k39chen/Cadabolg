	<h2>Backstory</h2>
	<hr/>
	<div>
		<p>
			The game is set in the backdrop of the <a href="#">Endless War</a> between the Holy Zekarian
			Empire and the Masari Union upon the continent of <a href="#">Antara</a>. The conflict began 
			over the control of border states that are rich with resources needed to sustain
			the growth of their respective nations, but eventually grew into a conflict of 
			ideologies (see "Holy Zekarian Empire" and "Masari Union" for details).
		</p>

		<p>
			The events of the game take place over a decade in the city-state of <a href="#">Adonis</a>. 
			<a href="#">Adonis</a> is located in between two warring nations: Holy Zekarian Empire (to 
			the East) and the Masari Union (to the West). Being located in a shielded 
			valley in the Blackiron mountain range and being politically neutral, <a href="#">Adonis</a> 
			has managed to avoid the ravages of war ongoing in other parts of the continent.
		</p>

		<p>
			Despite its relative isolation, <a href="#">Adonis</a> has grown over the centuries to become 
			a gathering place for Zekarian pilgrims and Masari entrepreneurs alike turning 
			it into a major trading and academic hub on the continent. Being a melting pot
			of different cultures and practices, social matters often become heated and so
			order is brought about by <a href="#">Adonis</a>'s Militia.
		</p>

		<p>
			The Militia acts as both its army and police force. It consists of citizens who
			volunteer for Militia service. They are trained in combat, war tactics and
			criminal investigation to enforce <a href="#">Adonis</a>'s laws. Militia members are usually
			organized into squads of 5-8. Roles vary from squad to squad, but there is
			typically a leader, one that organizes the squad's affairs, and a counselor,
			an experienced Militia member that acts in a advisory role.
		</p>
	</div>
	
	<h2>Act 1</h2>
	<hr/>
	<div>
		<p>
			MC registers to join the <a href="#">Adonis</a> Militia. MC joins <a href="#">Squad 2</a> are assigned to a
			mission inbvolving the crackdown of an arms smuggling ring that has operatives
			all over the city-state. <a href="#">Squad 2</a> catches the smugglers and discover that they
			are part of a conspiracy to nullify <a href="#">Adonis</a>'s neutrality with the warring
			nations.
		</p>
		
		<p>
			The next day, the <a href="#">Adonis</a> Assembly passes a bill to have the Militia arrest 
			Zekarian and Masari diplomats and execute them at the city Forum. The Militia 
			rejects these orders, but conspirators in their ranks start executing Zekarian 
			and Masari diplomats on their own accord.
		</p>
		
		<p>
			The news of the massacre reaches both nations. Within a few days, <a href="#">Adonis</a> 
			finds itself simultaneously beseiged by both Zekarian and Masari armies.
		</p>

		<h3>Design Note:</h3>
		<p>
			<i>
				The player is allowed to fully explore <a href="#">Adonis</a> although not all
				functions will be revealed. This is to contrast with Act 2 where
				<a href="#">Adonis</a> will be locked off and so unlocking sectors of <a href="#">Adonis</a>
				will be part of the player's incentive. This section is meant to
				be a tutorial for the main game, so it will be fairly directed
				and linear.
			</i>
		</p>
	</div>
	
	<h2>Act 2</h2>
	<hr/>
	<div>
		<p>
			The <a href="#">Adonis</a> Assembly surrenders within a few hours of the siege. Both the
			Assembly and the Militia are dissolved as a joint military occupation of the
			city-state takes place. A temporary ceasefire between the armies is declared
			within the confines of <a href="#">Adonis</a> resulting in the division of the city into
			Eastern and Western Blocs.
		</p>

		<p>
			The Eastern Bloc consisting of the <a href="#">Villa</a>, <a href="#">Temple</a>, <a href="#">Garden</a> and <a href="#"></a> sectors
			of the city comes under Zekarian control. Zekarian laws are placed upon the
			former citizens of <a href="#">Adonis</a> living there enforced by Zekarian <a href="#">Zealots</a>.
		</p>

		<p>
			The Western Bloc consisting of the <a href="#">Factory</a>, <a href="#">University</a>, <a href="#">Market</a> and 
			<a href="#">Slums</a> sectors of the city comes under Masari controls. Likewise, Masari laws
			are enforced in these areas by Masari <a href="#">Marines</a>. Between the two blocs is a
			Neutral Zone where negotiations are held. At the opposite edges of the Neutral
			Zone are barricades and watchtowers set up by both armies.
		</p>

		<p>
			MC is broken out of a prison in the Neutral Zone by Militia survivors lead by
			<a href="#">Squad 2</a> and taken underground to join the Resistance. The Resistance plans to
			destabilize the foreign powers that occupy <a href="#">Adonis</a> hoping to eventually gain
			enough support to oust them from the city altogether. 
		</p>

		<p>
			<a href="#">Squad 2</a> believes that both armies are looking for something called <a href="#">The 
			Crucible</a> within the confines of the city believing that it could turn the tides 
			of the <a href="#">Endless War</a>. MC is chosen to become the leader of the Resistance.
		</p>

		<h3>Design Note:</h3>
		<p>
			<i>
				This is the meat of the game. The player begins with very little
				and over the course of this act accquires more Resistance fighters,
				more contacts, more missions and more rewards. There are certain
				story objectives that need to be completed, but it is entirely up
				to the player how they want to approach them. ALL OF THIS IS A
				BUILD UP TO ACT 3.
			</i>
		</p>
	</div>
	
	<h2>Act 3</h2>
	<hr/>
	<div>
		<p>
			Both sides have weakened due to the Resistance's efforts, however, all three
			sides have come to learn of the location of <a href="#">The Crucible</a> which is located
			deep within the city. This begins a massive three-way battle between the 
			Zekarian, Masari and Resistance fighters with the winner obtaining 
			<a href="#">The Crucible</a>, an item that can change the tides of the war.
		</p>
		
		<h3>Design Note:</h3>
		<p>
			<i>
				This is the climax of the game's story. It is meant to be a 
				parallel to the impossible battle at the end of Act 1, however,
				this time the player actually stands a chance.
			</i>
		</p>
	</div>
	
	<h2>Act 4</h2>
	<hr/>
	<div>
		<p>
			The Resistance obtains The Crucible and ousts its oppressors from <a href="#">Adonis</a>.
			However, their stay left its mark. A previously unified city is now divided
			on a social level. With the dissolution of the <a href="#">Adonis</a> Assembly and the 
			control wrenched from Zekarian and Masari hands the question is: Who is in
			charge now?
		</p>

		<p>
			The Resistance fighters have split into factions following individual members
			of former <a href="#">Squad 2</a> each with their own beliefs on how <a href="#">Adonis</a> should be
			restructured. It is up to MC and power of The Crucible to choose how <a href="#">Adonis</a>
			should be reformed and bring in the support to make that happen.
		</p>

		<h3>Design Note:</h3>
		<p>
			<i>
				Act 4 has very little combat and there is more of an emphasis on
				the conversation/building aspects introduced earlier in the game.
				This is a resolution, which means that the story isn't over, but
				it is necessary to pave where the story is going.
			</i>
		</p>
	</div>
	
	<h2>Act 5</h2>
	<hr/>
	<div>
		<p>
			Depending on the MC's choice, <a href="#">Adonis</a> is reborn into a new city. The survivors
			of the Zekarian and Masari occupation are now in the phase of finding closure
			with what happened during the occupation. Mobs of survivors are looking for
			someone to blame, which just happens to be you, the leader of the Resistance.
		</p>

		<p>
			MC is taken to trial for war crimes and must defend him/her self for his/her
			actions. All the people that MC's helped or built trust with come as witnesses
			to support him/her. All the people that MC's screwed over will come to testify
			against you.
		</p>

		<p>
			The day before the ending of the trial. MC will meet the survivors of <a href="#">Squad 2</a>
			at the burnt remains of the Militia Barracks where they will reflect on the
			events in the past few years. Some will be bitter while others sweet. 
			Nonetheless, all agree that no matter what the verdict, MC will live on as the
			founder of a new <a href="#">Adonis</a>.
		</p>

		<p>
			The verdict is passed. Depending on how well MC defend his/her actions, the
			MC will be declared innocent or guilty. However, the verdict doesn't matter as
			all the pieces of the puzzle have come together.
		</p>

		<p>
			Now begins the post-game.
		</p>

		<h3>Design Note:</h3>
		<p>
			<i>
				Act 5 is conclusion of the story. It is to reflect upon the exact
             actions on the player and ask them if circumstances had been 
             different would they have done it differently. It is also to show
             what the player has achieved by playing the game and wrap up loose
             ends or open new windows for future games.

	<h2>Appendix</h2>
	<hr/>
	<p>
	This section contains information to support the reader's understanding about the game's world.
	</p>
	
	<div>
		<h3>Antara Continent</h3>
		<p>
		The continent 
		</p>
	</div>
	
	<div>
		<h3>Holy Zekarian Empire</h3>
		<p>
			The Holy Zekarian Empire is an autocratic theocracy. The Immortal Emperor Zekar,
			a living connection to six Elemental Gods known collectively as <a href="#">The Pantheon</a>, 
			has complete authority over all those who worship him and the Elemental Gods. 
			Zekar's words are few, but they are absolute and disobeying them is punishable 
			by things worse than death.
		</p>
		<h4>History</h4>
		<p>
			In his earlier years (nine hundred years ago), Zekar preached about living in 
			harmony with nature to deepen one's understanding about the world. Zekar taught 
			his followers how to use the force of nature to empower oneself and defeat 
			obstacles in what is now known as the venerable art of Magic. Zekar's followers 
			would tattoo themselves with special symbols from the juices of fruit to improve
			their connection with nature and make their magic stronger. This is a practice
			that has remained in Zekarian culture over the years marking the coming of age
			of both men and women. Zekar's messianic status was further strengthened by his 
			ability to tame ferocious monsters that threatened the lives of village 
			communities. This gave rise to the Zekarian practice of domesticating monsters 
			to assist people with their daily work.
		</p>
		<p>
			In his later years (six hundred years ago), Zekar and his followers established
			the Holy Zekarian Empire as a nation along the eastern seaboard of <a href="#">Antara</a>. 
			Fundamental to the empire's foundation was the <a href="#">Covenant of the Pantheon</a>, an 
			order consisting of Zekar's most devoted followers. The <a href="#">Covenant</a>'s purpose was
			to spread the word of Zekar throughout the continent bringing in as many 
			communities and followers as they could.
		</p>
		<p>
			As many nations disagreed with the radical luddism preached by the <a href="#">Covenant</a>,
			it became necessary for the Empire to defend its people and beliefs. The empire
			conscripted its young men and women to become <a href="#">Zealots</a>, holy warriors that
			would be allowed to commit sins on their soul for the sake of the Empire. The
			Empire's <a href="#">Zealots</a>, through the <a href="#">Covenant</a>'s extensive knowledge in magic and
			vast resources, were turned into an unstoppable military force.
		</p>
		<p>
			Over two hundred years ago, the <a href="#">Zealots</a> met their match when they encountered
			Masari <a href="#">Marines</a> during the Zekarian occupation of a neutral state. This led to
			what is now called the <a href="#">Endless War</a>, a stalemate between the two nations over
			complete control of all resources on the continent.
		</p>
		<p>
			In recent years (hundred years ago to present), there has been a dramatic shift
			in power from Emperor Zekar to the <a href="#">Covenant</a>, as the <a href="#">Covenant</a> has managed to
			take over every aspect of the empire. There are few pundits who suggest that
			Zekar is little more than a figurehead nowadays and that someday, the 
			<a href="#">Covenant</a> will do away with Zekar's rule altogether.
		</p>
		
		<h3>Masari Union</h3>
		<p>
			The Masari Union is a political and economic conglomeration of many smaller 
			nations that share an interest technology and how it can improve humans.
