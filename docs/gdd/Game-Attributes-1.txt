//Status Effects//
Actors can have one status effect at a time. The current status effect can be
seen on the Actor's mugshot on the HUD. The default status effect is Normal.
An Actor induces a status effect if they are the target of a skill which 
inflicts it. The chance of getting a status effect is random, but based on
the difference between the Actor and the Target's potency and immunity of said
status effect respectively. A status effect can be cancelled (returning the
Actor to Normal) if the opposing status effect is induced.
