		<h1>Campagin</h1>
		<p>
		Over the course of hundreds of years two nations, the Holy Zekarrian Empire and the Masari Union,  have grown to the point where 
		peaceful coexistence is no longer an option. Having large civilian populations, it is imperative for both to accquire resources 
		to sustain the future of their people. Seeing that the only solution to this dilemma was taking each other's resources, both 
		superpowers declared war upon each other leading to the longest and most bloody conflict the world has seen. Ten years into the war,
		it has become apparent that both nations are at a stalemate and the war has become one of attrition threatening to ruin both nations
		unless one side had something to turn the tide of the war in their favor.
		</p>
		<p>
		During the course of the war many people on both sides lost their homes, friends and families. Seeking a way out of the war, a group
		of idealistic intellectuals lead refugees on both sides to an island continent south of the main continent in hopes of building a
		safe haven for those who didn't want to be part of the war. These intellectuals sought to break the ancient taboo of combining magic
		and technology to protect the island from the avarice of the Holy Zekarrain Empire and the Masari Union. Although the island was hidden
		away from the view, directions to the island are passed on secretly through a song sung by refugees on both sides. 
		</p>
		<p>
		As far as official records go on both sides, the island doesn't exist. However, the number of casualties and drain in economic resources
		has caused both superpowers to consider fringe theories as possibly viable ways to win the war. Some are even willing to break the ancient
		taboo and start developing weapons using a fusion of magic and technology. What better place to accquire that from than the legendary island
		that has it all? One day, a distress signal was sent on all military band frequencies coming from the island telling people to stay away from
		the island at all costs. Both sides managed to triangulate the signal back to the a place in the middle of the Southern Ocean where the island
		is believed to be located.

		<h1>Characters</h1>
		<h2>Zekarian</h2>
			<h3>Eras Vierge</h3>
		<h2>Masari</h2>
			<h3>Lia Thelma</h3>
			<p>
			99th iteration of the "Thelma" series. Although she looks like a fully grown woman in her late 20s, she is more aking to a newborn
			given that she has only been revived a few days after the fall of Uran. Her lack of experience manifests itself in a curious naivete.
			However, when in a tough situation, memories of her past selves resurface to meet the challenge at hand. Over the course of the game,
			Lia proves herself to be a capable leader that is capable of both compassion and ruthlessness once again depending on what the
			situation calls for.
			</p>
			<p>
			Lia struggles with her true identity during the events of the game. As she becomes stronger and more experienced, memories of her past 
			iterations resurface melding their personalities with hers. At first she fears that her past iterations are trying to take over her, but learns
			that they only wish for her best and want her to experience life at its fullest because of her short life.

		<h1>Terminology</h1>
			<h2>Zekarian</h2>
				<h3>Magic</h3>
				<p>
				Manipulating the flow of mana and the interaction of the eight elements (Light, Air, Water, Wood, Earth, Fire, Spark, Dark)
				through one's will often with the assistance of Magical Tools, such as Seals and Mantras. It is used predominantly in the
				Zekarian Empire and outlawed in the Masari Union.
				</p>
				<p>
				Archmagus Darveim determined that all magical spells follow the same procedures, but use different means to achieve the caster's
				goal:
				<ol>
					<li>Creation of Metaphysical Space</li>
					<li>Invocation of Elemental Spirits</li>
					<li>Definition of Spell Procedure</li>
					<li>Sending of Elemental Spirits</li>
				</ol>
				</p>
				<h3>Elemental Spirits</h3>
				<p>
				Forces of nature that are aligned to one of the eight elements. When spirits are gathered in masse, the metaphysical space around
				</p>
				</p>
				<h3>Seal</h3>
				<p>
				A form of magical tool. Often drawn on the surfaces of objects or floors. Unlike Mandalas, the size of the seal does not dictate
				the area of metaphysical effect. This is why seals are often effective security deterrents.
				</p>
				<p>
				The Eastern Zekarian School of Magic uses what are known as <b>Hand Seals</b>, which are specific positions the caster's two
				hands must take in order to create the metaphysical space, invoke the s
				</p>
				<h3>Mantra</h3>
				<p>
				A form of magical tool through the recitation of selected words of power. Mantras are divided into three verses:
				Invocation, Chorus and Sending. The Invocation verse creates the opening metaphysical structure for the spell and
				invites elemental spirits into the space of the spell. The Chorus verse defines the procedure the elemental spirits
				must follow. The Chorus verse is repeated over and over to retain the spell's desired effect. If the Chorus is
				interupted, it can backfire on the caster. To conclude the effect of the spell, the Sending Chorus must be recited.
				</p>
				<h3>Mandala</h3>
				<p>
				</p>
				<h3>Monster</h3>
				<p>
				Categorization given to zoological species whose physiology has been modified through the use of Magic often for the purposes
				of domestication, doing manual labor and combat.
				</p>
				<p>
				Magically modifying human physiology is STRICTLY FORBIDDEN.
				</p>
			<h2>Masari</h2>
				<h3>Tehcnology</h3>
				<p>
				</p>
				<h3>Golem</h3>
				<p>
				An artificially created humanoid being that is made to assist humans in manual labor and can be modified for combat.
				Golems are predominantly manufactured and used by the Masari Union while human workforces are put to more specialized
				tasks. The presence of Golems are banned in the Zekarian Empire where they are considered an abomination and destroyed 
				on sight, which is an easy task given that most Golems are not built to resist Magic.
				</p>
				<p>
				In their initial stages of their development, Golems were not as responsive to human behavior because they weren't 
				programmed as well as they are now leading to much consumer frustration with Golem servants and eventual acts of 
				discrimination. This led to the <b>Universal Charter of Golem Rights</b> was created by the Chairman and the Board of
				Directors to protect Golems from humans and themselves.			
				</p>
				<p>
				As far as research shows, Golems are not sentient making their sentience a challenge and major question of contention
				amongst Masari academics.
				</p>
				<h3>Augments (Augs)</h3>
				<p>
				Mechanical addition to a human body improving or adding a particular function.
				</p>
				<h3>Implants (Imps)</h3>
				<p>
				Nanomechnical addition to a human body that improves or adds organ activity.
				</p>
				<h3>Astral Fields Theory</h3>
				<p>
				Proposed by Dr. Rai Danaan who claims that all living beings generate a uniform field of electromagnetic interference
				around them which Dr. Danaan calls an Astral Field. This field is controlled unconciously and is what early spiritiualists
				called Auras. By activating the right parts of the brain, it has been possible for subjects to gain control of their Astral
				Field conciously. This has led to a subject's ability to perform telekinesis (by shaping the field to interact with another
				entity. Note: harder to do on living beings), mind reading (by extending the field and gathering information of other entities)
				etc. Working in tandem with implants or psychoactive drugs, fields can be consistently manipulated at the eventually expense of
				the subjects ability to think coherently.
				</p>
				<p>
				Astral fields can't be created by non-living beings such as machines or Golems, however, a human being can interface with
				certain types of machines (Psychic Amplifiers) to improve their astral field projection and ability to process its information.
				This discovery is applied on an island wide scale as part of the Akashic Mandala defense iniative taken by the Kingdom of Uran,
				where the island's Core serves as the human subject and interfaces with ten Golems known as Muses to gather and process information
				on all beings across the island in real time (see Akashic Mandala for details).
