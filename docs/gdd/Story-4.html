Masari have a military police force (sort of like the FBI) that has access to a 
lot of sensitive information. They work in collaboration with the official
police force

//Bloody Summit Arc//

In the beginning of the story, they get an anonymous tip that a bombing will 
occur during the Masari Economic Summit where leaders of Masarian corporations
will meet and discuss policies that may come into effect in coming years (sort 
of like a G-20/DDA Summit). The [Masari Investigation Bureau] deploys four 
agents at the working in coordination with the [Nexus City Police Department] in
order to secure the summit from protests and stop the bombing (although only 
[MIB] know of it).

The fifth MES was happening in Nexus city's T&D (Trade and Development) Dome 
between 23-24 Fyr. It would be open to the press and upper echelon corporate 
leaders. The main event would be a panel with the four biggest corporate 
magnates of the nation to discuss how to deal with massive levels of 
unemployment the nation faces on 24 Fyr.

Agent Amaryllis was deployed in charge of dealing with the anonymous tip. Under
her command are three NCPD members: Chad (a Human/Male/Healer), Ophelia (a 
Human/Female/Greifer) and Hyperion (a Golem/Male/Tank). Amaryllis is instructed
by her superior Director Nightshade to use them as she sees fit even as meat
shields if the situation calls for it.

On the first day of the Summit, the team spends their time reviewing security
camera footage and review security checks made at various locations of the T&D
Dome. One particular concern is the prostestors outside the dome who are
opposed to the corporations meeting. The protestors outside the dome are being 
held back by riot police lead in coordination with Agent Aconite.

As the summit closed for the day, the Agents gathered in the security room
exchanging their observations. Agent Aconite reports that the protestors were
successfully kept at bay, but situations may worsen when the main event happens
the next day. Agent Wolfsbane


Protestors break through and invade the conference room just when the human
bombs go off destroying the T&D Dome both from top and bottom. Hundreds of
people are killed. Hours later, rescue teams manage to rescue a mere five
people including Agent Amaryllis.

Weeks later, in Director Nightshade's office, Amaryllis tells Nightshade about
the events that happened during what known called the Bloody Summit. She ends
on what the bomber told her before he detonated the bombs claiming the he was
from Heaven's Shadow. This catches Nightshade's attention as he recognizes the
term from somewhere.
